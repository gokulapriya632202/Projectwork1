## FARM2FUTURE AI-DRIVEN PRICE PREDICTION FOR ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES
Farm2Future is an AI-driven commodity price forecasting system that leverages time-series and deep learning models to predict future retail prices of essential agricultural commodities across Indian states.
By integrating ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models into a stacked ensemble framework, it provides data-driven price insights to support farmers, traders, and policymakers in informed decision-making.

## About
Farm2Future is an AI-based price forecasting system designed to predict daily retail prices of essential agricultural commodities across Indian States and Union Territories. The project focuses on modeling historical price trends using officially recorded government price data to address real-world price volatility affecting farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

The system uses a hybrid forecasting approach by combining ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models to capture linear trends, seasonality, and nonlinear temporal patterns in commodity prices. Predictions from individual models are integrated using a stacked ensemble strategy to improve forecast stability and reduce model-specific bias.

The dataset spans January 2024 to October 2025 and includes daily prices of cereals, pulses, edible oils, dairy products, and vegetables. A time-aware train–test split is applied to ensure realistic forecasting, and model performance is evaluated using standard error metrics such as MSE, MAE, RMSE.

Farm2Future is built as a research-oriented project for experimentation with time-series forecasting techniques and serves as a practical reference for applying ensemble learning to real-world agricultural price data.
